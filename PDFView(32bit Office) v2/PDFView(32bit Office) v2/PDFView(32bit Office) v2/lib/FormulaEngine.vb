' FormulaEngine - A library for parsing and managing formulas
' Copyright © 2007 Eugene Ciloci
'

''' <summary>
''' Implements all the functionality of a formula engine
''' </summary>
''' <remarks>This is the main class of this library.  It is responsible for managing formulas, their dependencies, and
''' all recalculations.  You can think of this class as a container for formulas.  It has methods for adding and removing formulas and
''' methods for recalculating all formulas that depend on a given reference.</remarks>
''' <example>This example shows how you can declare a formula that points to a cell and have the formula engine recalculate it
''' when you tell it that the cell has changed:
''' <code>
''' Dim engine As New FormulaEngine
''' ' Declare a reference to cell B2
''' Dim b2Ref As ISheetReference = engine.ReferenceFactory.Parse("B2")
''' ' Add a formula that depends on cell A1 at cell B2
''' engine.AddFormula("A1+1", b2Ref)
''' ' Declare a reference to cell A1
''' Dim a1Ref As ISheetReference = engine.ReferenceFactory.Parse("A1")
''' ' Tell the engine that cell A1 has changed at which point it will recalculate the formula at B2
''' engine.Recalculate(a1Ref)
''' ' Remove the formula at B2
''' engine.RemoveFormulaAt(b2Ref)
''' </code>
''' </example>
